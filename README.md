web-site for base of melanoma

Hello! 
I am a student of National Research Nuclear University MEPhI. I am going to create a website, which will gather data about melanoma of skin all over the world. So I decided to start to tackle this academic task with the help of the CS50 course. 

In the end scientists and doctors will have an opportunity to upload information about melanoma they treat. Gathered information will help others to make a right diagnosis. 

This is only a beginning, “wrapper” of the medical web database. It describes the general information about the disease. 

it has 4 HTML pages
It has a table on the symptoms page 
it has images on all pages
it has lists (general info, statistics, symptoms pages) 
It has navbar and carousel components of bootstrap 4 library 
it has grid model of bootstrap 4 
it has 2 columns (general info, symptoms, statistics pages)

there is one media request to provide better appearance on small screen
